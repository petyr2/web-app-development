    <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
    <p>
        You’ll find a collection of projects, training experiences, and skills that reflect my journey 
        as an aspiring cybersecurity professional and telecommunications engineer. 
        <br><br>
        Each project highlights my ability to apply theory into practice — from building secure web applications 
        with Flask to detecting Wi-Fi attacks using embedded systems. 
        <br><br>
        My goal is to showcase not only what I’ve built, but also how I approach problem-solving, 
        continuous learning, and innovation in networking and cybersecurity.

    <h3>Web Development</h3>
    <p>
        Built a personal portfolio website using Flask, featuring dedicated routes for bio, projects, 
        and an elevator pitch.
        <br>
        The project emphasizes security-aware development and backend logic, demonstrating both 
        web development and cybersecurity principles.

    <h3>CTF Development (In Progress)</h3>
    <p>
        I am currently developing a Capture the Flag (CTF) platform for cybersecurity training. 
        <br>
        This ongoing project aims to provide a space where users can engage with challenges in areas 
        such as web security, cryptography, forensics, and networking.

    <h3>Electrical and CCTV Installation</h3>
    <p>
        Beyond software and cybersecurity projects, I also bring strong practical skills in electrical 
        and telecommunications engineering. 
        <br>
        I have hands-on experience in electrical installations, ensuring safe and reliable wiring systems 
        for small-scale setups.
        <br>
        In addition, I have worked on CCTV installation projects, handling both hardware configuration 
        and network integration to create secure surveillance systems.
        <br><br>
        These experiences highlight my ability to bridge the gap between physical infrastructure 
        and digital security.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        By combining this foundation in electrical and CCTV systems with my growing expertise in 
        cybersecurity and backend development, I position myself as a versatile professional who can 
        design, secure, and maintain both the physical and digital layers of modern technology environments.
